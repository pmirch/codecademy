      Basic Git Workflow
git init creates a new Git repository
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git add filename_1 filename_2 adds multiple files to the staging area with a single command.
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit -m "message" permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository. The -m flag and its quoted message is required.
git log shows a list of all previous commits
      How to Backtrack
git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
git reset SHA: Can be used to reset to a previous commit in your commit history.
      Git Branching
git branch: Lists all a Git project's branches.
git branch branch_name: Creates a new branch.
git checkout branch_name: Used to switch from one branch to another.
git merge branch_name: Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
git branch -d branch_name: Deletes the branch specified.
